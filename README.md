# Code Helper
The idea behind this project is to create a collective bookmarks resource for students of code.

The idea for it is based on the idea of a mixtape. Take an independent radio station like HFSU for example. Each of their DJs has their own show, in which they play whatever comes to mind. This is, to Code Helper's app's creators, a much more exciting way to discover music than by relying on current discovery algorithms. When you listen to a DJ who spins tracks all laissez-faire-like, you end up hearing nothing but what the DJ _likes_. And it turns out, when you rely on the tastes of an expert to guide you to new things, you tend to discover some cool shit you may never have learned about before.
